# Ease.js Code of Conduct

As the creator of Ease.js, I want this to be a friendly place for developers of all ages.

1. **Be Kind**: No bullying or mean comments.
2. **Be Helpful**: If someone is struggling with Node.js, help them out.
3. **Be Professional**: Keep discussions focused on the code and making Ease.js better.
4. **Be Respectful**: Everyone was a beginner once!

If someone is being mean, please email me at **rudrafordev@protonmail.com**.
