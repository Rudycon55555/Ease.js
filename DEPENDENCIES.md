# Ease.js Dependencies

One of the best things about Ease.js is that it is **Lightweight** (only makes full-stack web development easier).

### Required:
- **Node.js**: Version 20.12.2 (or higher)
- **Operating System**: Any

### External Packages:
- **None**: Ease.js uses 100% native Node.js APIs. No `npm install` is required for the core engine!
