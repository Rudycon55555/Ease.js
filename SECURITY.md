# Security Policy

Ease.js takes security very seriously. We have built-in protections against Shell Injection and Directory Traversal.

### Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security hole, please **do not** post it on the public issue tracker (hackers/exploiters might take advantage of it being right in public). Instead, please email me at:
**rudrafordev@protonmail.com**

I will work with you to fix the issue and release an update as fast as possible.
